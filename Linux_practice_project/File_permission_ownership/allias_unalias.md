# alias and unalias Command

## Purpose
When we often have to use a single big command multiple times, in those cases, we create something called as alias for that command. Alias is like a shortcut command which will have same functionality as if we are writing the whole command.

unalias deletes an existing alias
## syntax
alias CD='cat Devops'

unalias CD
